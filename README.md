a simple game for beginner to learn how function work in python

# how to play?
this is the prototype of the function
```python = 
def func(winDifference, lastChoice, lastRoundWL):
    # winDifference from -4 to 4
    # lastChoice from 1 to 3, means whats the last choice from opponent, 1 means paper, 2 means scissors, 3 means stone
    # lasrRound WL from 0 to 2, 0 means draw, 1 means win, 2 means loss

    # return from 1 to 3, 1 means paper, 2 means scissors, 3 means stone
```
u can build your own function depends on what index u want to rely on

# test ur function
replace line 3 to line 7 in `test.py` with the function u build
and it will test ur function of there is nothing wrong
